# Simple-Cookie-Consent-Button
A really simple but useful cookie consent set up for websites.

This is a really simple and light weight method for confirming the use of cookies and anything else you need really. 

As standard this saves a key and value in the users local storage. This can be changes easily to session storage (if needed) and can also be amended to for creating a cookie. I will be adding in a few more nice to haves later down the line; however, as or now this is a fully customable consent button that is very light weight.
